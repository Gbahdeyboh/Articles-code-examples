# A Guide To Object Based Comparison In JavaScript

I was reading [JavaScript grammar](http://javascriptgrammar.com/dark/) by [javascript tutor](https://twitter.com/js_tut), when i suddenly came across comparing objects in one of the chapters. Some years back when i was still learning some basic javascript, i found it difficult to wrap my head around primitive data types and objects. It just didn’t make sense to me why comparison operators didn’t work with objects.

Reading about this same problem in javascript grammar brought the problem back to memory and inspired me to write a basic boilerplate code that helps with comparing both simple and complex objects by using a recursive function.
