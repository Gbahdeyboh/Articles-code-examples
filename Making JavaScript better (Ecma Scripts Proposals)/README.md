# Making JavaScript better (Ecma Scripts Proposals)


Over the years, JavaScript has evolved from a language that runs in the client side browser into something that runs on so many things these days. The TC39 committee is responsible for eveolving the language specification and its standardization. As a Javascript developer, we could make the language itself better by submitting proposals, feature requests to the TC39 team alongside an implementation polyfill. I figured out most developers don't know this and decided to explain it in details in an article.
